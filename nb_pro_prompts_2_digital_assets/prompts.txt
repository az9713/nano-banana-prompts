Using the uploaded image as the exact scene, camera, and composition reference, recreate the same visual illusion where a hand is pouring my own branded drink from a glass bottle into a glass held by a person inside a smartphone screen.
Replace the original bottle with my uploaded drink while keeping:
- The same pouring angle
- The same realistic liquid flow
- The same smartphone position, desk, window light, and background setup
The person inside the phone should remain smiling naturally and holding the glass inside the screen, with realistic depth and screen edge reflections so it looks like the drink is actually crossing from the real world into the digital screen.
The liquid should match my drink's color and transparency, with:
- Realistic splash physics
- Natural highlights
- Tiny bubbles and refraction inside the stream
Lighting must stay soft natural daylight from the window, with warm indoor tones and subtle shadows on the wooden desk.
Style: ultra-photorealistic advertising composite, hyper-real realism, shallow depth of field, commercial product photography quality, 8K detail.
Important:
- Use the uploaded image strictly for pose, framing, lighting, and perspective matching.
- Only change the drink branding, label text, and liquid color to match my custom product.
